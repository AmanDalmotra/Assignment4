This repository contains two Python programs demonstrating basic file handling operations in Python.

Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
Description:
This Python program:
1.) Opens and reads a text file named sample.txt.
2.) Prints its content line by line.
3.) Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.

Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
Description:
This Python program:
1.) Takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt.
2.) Appends additional data to the same file.
3.) Reads and displays the final content of the file.
